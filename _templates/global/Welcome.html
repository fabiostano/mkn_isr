        <h4>1. EXPERIMENT PROCEDURE</h4>
        <p>The experiment consists of multiple phases. Explanations for all phases will be displayed at the beginning. You will complete one task related to decision-making, and one mental arithmetic task. The tasks have a fixed time limit. After the task rounds, questionnaires will be displayed.</p>

        <h4>2. QUESTIONNAIRE INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
        <p>When answering the questionnaires about your experiences in the experiment, it is particularly important to
            note that only your personal impressions matter. There are no answers that are better or worse for this research,
            nor answers that would make you look better or worse. Try to be honest with yourself. The question format
            typically used in this experiment is shown as an example in the following image:</p>
        <div class="col d-flex justify-content-center">
                <img src="{% static 'DemoTask.png' %}" alt="2" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 95%; height: auto;">
            </div>
        <p>You will indicate on a scale how much the statement applies to you or how strongly you experienced something.
            If, as shown in the figure above, you don't like a type of task, you should select a field further to the left.
            If your enjoyment is moderate, choose the option in the middle. We recommend answering intuitively and directly,
            without much thinking. This is not only easier but is also usually just as precise as a carefully considered answer.</p>

        <h4>3. PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS</h4>
        <p>For some participants, Eye-Tracking and EEG data are recorded.
            In this case, please avoid movement as much as possible during the experiment.
            Also, avoid touching the sensors or scratching near them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="explanation-container">
        <h4>4. FINAL REMARKS</h4>
        <p>If you have any questions about the experiment now, please ask the experiment staff.
            If you have questions during the experiment, please open the cabin door.
            A member of the experiment team will then come to assist you. If any problems arise,
            you can stop the experiment at any time.</p>
