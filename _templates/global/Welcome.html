        <h4>1. EXPERIMENT PROCEDURE</h4>
        <p>The experiment consists of multiple phases. Explanations for all phases will be displayed at the beginning. In 5 rounds, you will complete tasks. The tasks will be provided automatically under a fixed time limit. After the last 4 rounds of tasks, questionnaires will be displayed.</p>

        <h4>2. QUESTIONNAIRE INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
        <p>When answering the questionnaires, it is particularly important to note that only your personal impressions matter. There are no answers that are better or worse for this research, nor answers that would make you look better or worse. Try to be honest with yourself. The question format typically used in this experiment is shown as an example in the following image:</p>

        <p>You will indicate on a scale how much the statement applies to you or how strongly you experienced something. If, as shown in Figure 1, you felt that a task was not very difficult, you should select a field further to the left. If the difficulty was in the medium range, choose the option in the middle. We recommend answering intuitively and directly, without much thinking. This is not only easier but is also usually just as precise as a carefully considered answer.</p>

        <h4>3. PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS</h4>
        <p>Please avoid movement as much as possible during the experiment. Also, avoid touching the sensors or scratching near them. Please refrain from speaking when it is not necessary. All of these behaviors can lead to measurement errors.</p>

        <h4>4. FINAL REMARKS</h4>
        <p>If you have any questions about the experiment now, please ask the experiment staff. If you have questions during the experiment, please open the cabin door. A member of the experiment team will then come to assist you. If any problems arise, you can stop the experiment at any time.</p>
