            In this task, you will solve mental arithmetic problems in a group of 3 people.
            A task is solved correctly if <strong>at least 2 group members provide the correct <b style="color: red">final solution</b></strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In each round, you will only see <b>two parts of each equation</b>.
            Thus, <strong style="color: red">to get to the final solution</strong>, you will have to coordinate with your group.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can show the others which part of the equation you are working on by clicking on an answer field (it will then appear colored to others).

            Once you submit your final answer by pressing "Enter" on the keyboard, you will no longer be able to change anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each round will be shown for <strong>30 seconds</strong> only. Please answer as fast and accurately as possible.
            You can enter your final solution 10 seconds after the equation has been shown. After each equation, there will be a 4-second break.
        </p>
        <p>
            A round is over when the time is up or if all 3 group members have submitted their final answer.
            Remember: <strong>A task is only solved correctly if at least 2 of your group provide the correct solution in the <b style="color: red">final answer field</b></strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the next stage, you will complete a <strong style="color: red">5-minute practice round</strong> to try out the task.
            This round won’t count toward your group’s score.
