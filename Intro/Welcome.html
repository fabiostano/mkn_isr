        <h4>EXPERIMENT PROCEDURE</h4>
        <p>
            The experiment consists of multiple tasks. Explanations for all tasks will be displayed at the beginning.
            You will complete a decision-making task, and a mental arithmetic task.
            The tasks have multiple rounds, each with a fixed time limit.
            After the task rounds, questionnaires will be displayed.
        </p>

        <h4>QUESTIONNAIRE INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
        <p>
            When answering the questionnaires about your experiences in the experiment, it is particularly important to
            note that only your personal impressions matter. There are no answers that are better or worse for this research,
            nor answers that would make you look better or worse. Try to be honest with yourself.
            We recommend answering intuitively and directly, without much thinking.
            This is not only easier but is also usually just as precise as a carefully considered answer.
